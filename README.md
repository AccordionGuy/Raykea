[IKEA Place](https://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/ikea-launches-augmented-reality-application_o) was one of the hottest apps when ARKit first came out. It lets you see what IKEA furniture would look like in your home! ***Raykea*** is a similar app that you can build, and youâ€™d be surprised how easy it is to put together (probably easier than putting IKEA furniture together).

This app was the second of four apps that I presented for the ARKit Workshop at the [RWDevCon 2018 conference.](https://www.rwdevcon.com/) I built the app in front of the audience, who were invited to code along with me.
